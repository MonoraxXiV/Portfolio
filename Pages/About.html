<h1> About me</h1>

<p> I am a bit of a knowledge hoarder, I have tons of guides and materials bookmarked in case I should ever need it.
    I love comparing my designs to different media. Did I pick a good color scheme, does it hurt the eyes?
    If it's the color scheme, the lay out, or the responsiveness I love to adapt things until they are visually
    pleasing.
    I've always been inspired by design and how things are built up. During my time at Digital arts and entertainment I
    learned a lot about design and colors.
    While my digital art may not be on point, I do try to get my webpages up to snuff.

<h2>A bit of history</h2>
<p> I am a junior web developer who realized she wanted a change in life in 2018.
    After a struggle with my mental health and physical health decided to work on my own skills, without the pressure of
    others.
    This is how I ended up learning welding with my father. We worked with small steps, then went on the apply said
    steps to small projects.
    This way I learned that working in projects, the planning, having a goal helped a lot with motivation.
    Once the lockdown started I also picked up cooking, to help my father have less stress during the weeks and having
    more time for himself to relax.</p>

<p>In july 2020 my sister had found a workshop programming and asked if I wanted to attend with her. We looked into it
    and found out it was a 7 month bootcamp.
    So while not a workshop, I was doubting myself, I did have some prior experience with C++ in game development, but
    not a great one.
    I have always been a bit of a scaredy cat before, but I tried to improve myself, get a bit better everyday. Learned
    to trust in myself and my skills.
    After some debating I decided to sign up, do my best for the selections. See where we get. To my own suprise I got
    in and while not all days are as great, we keep learning.
    We fall, we get up, we google, we learn. Having off days is fine, as long as you keep pressing on and do your best
    to make it into a win, even if it's a small one.</p>
